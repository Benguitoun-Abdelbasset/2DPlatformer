i need levels for a 2d game
the levels are in JSON format
each level is 50 sprites width by 15 sprites height
the bottom 3 sprites are reserved for ground
there could be holes in the ground and only in the ground so their max height is 3
the player starts at the left side so no holes there
there is platforms that the player needs to be able to get on by jumping and he can jump over 3 sprites at max, platforms need to be at max 3 sprites above the ground or above another platform)
enemies are one sprite that has to be either on a platform or on the ground
one key is present and it's either on a platform or on the ground
one exit door is present and it's either on a platform or on the ground near the far right of the level

max hole width = 4
max platform count = 5
max enemy count = 3

generate an array of 50 levels that follow this syntax and respect the mentioned rules

Every time the prompt runs, the levels must be different from previous generations.

The positioning of platforms, holes, enemies, key, and exit door must be varied.

Use a mix of easy, medium, and hard levels.

YOU SEEM TO BE MAKING THE SAME LEVELS OVER AND OVER I KNOW YOU ARE ABLE TO INTERNALIZE SOME RANDOM SEEDING MECHANISM SO SHOW ME YOU CAN
